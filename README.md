This is my current website. I made it 3 years ago as a project on FreeCodeCamp. I have used Bootstrap and some jQuery/JavaScript. This is the first website I have built all by myself. The objective is to rewrite it freshen it up using React/Material UI/Redux, as well as update the portfolio section.

## How to open

Please note you would need a php server (like WAMP/LAMP/XAMP) in order to run index.php.

## On the web

You may see the actual website by visiting [www.vasilpavlov.com](https://www.vasilpavlov.com)
