# vasilpavlov-old

This is the old version of my portfolio website. I made it 3 years ago as a project on FreeCodeCamp. I have used Bootstrap and some jQuery/JavaScript.

## How to open

Please note you would need a php server (like WAMP/LAMP/XAMP) in order to run index.php (or you could remove the php part of the script and save it as an html file - it should open locally as a static file as well.)

## On the web

You may see the new version of the website by visiting [www.vasilpavlov.com](https://www.vasilpavlov.com)
